# Recursion_Review

## The concepts covered in this lab include:

1. Recursion in OOP.
2. Abstract classes and concrete subclasses.
3. Tree-like data structures.
4. Inheritance and polymorphism in Python.
5. String representation of objects.
6. Recursive searching algorithms.

## Brief summary
In this lab, you will practice recursion in object-oriented programming by building a tree-like data structure using three concrete subclasses of one abstract class. The three concrete classes are named `Orthrus`, `Cerberus`, and `Head`, and they have specific attributes and methods. You will need to implement the string representation and search methods for each class, and ensure that the objects can be instantiated and used correctly in the provided example code. The lab will cover concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, class attributes and methods, and recursive searching algorithms.

## Plan for the lab
1. Review the concept of recursion in OOP and the use of abstract classes and concrete subclasses.
2. Implement the three concrete subclasses `Orthrus`, `Cerberus`, and `Head` with their respective attributes and methods.
3. Write the string representation method (str) for each concrete subclass.
4. Write the search method for each concrete subclass using recursion to traverse the tree-like data structure.
5. Test the functionality of the classes by creating instances of each and using them to search for specific names.
