# Fraction_Class

### The concepts covered in this lab are:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python
2. Defining and implementing classes and objects in Python
3. Magic and non-magic methods in Python
4. Type hinting and Error handling in Python

### Plan for the lab

1. Class definition and constructor method init.
2. Implementing str and repr magic methods.
3. Implementing mul and add magic methods.
4. Implementing a simplify method that reduces a fraction to its simplest terms.
5. Integrating simplify into init, add, and mul.
