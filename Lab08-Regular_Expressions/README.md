# Regular_Expressions

## The concepts covered in this lab include:

1. Regular expressions and their use in Python's re module
2. String validation using regular expressions

## Brief summary
This lab involves creating a sign-up interface for an application using Python. The lab requires the creation of two functions, "validate_email" and "validate_password", which validate email and password inputs based on specific criteria using regular expressions. The lab also involves user input, conditional statements, looping, and error handling to ensure that the input provided is valid. Once the input is validated, the program allows the user to sign up by accepting the input and displaying a "sign up successful" message.

## Plan for the lab
1. Define the function "validate_email(email)" that takes an email address as an argument and uses regular expressions to validate it based on the criteria outlined in the lab. The function should return True if the email is valid and False otherwise. The function should prompt the user for a valid email if the input is not valid.
2. Define the function "validate_password(password)" that takes a password as an argument and uses regular expressions to validate it based on the criteria outlined in the lab. The function should return True if the password is valid and False otherwise. The function should prompt the user for a valid password if the input is not valid.
3. Create a small program that uses the functions defined above to prompt the user for an email and password until both inputs are valid. The program should then display a "sign up successful" message.
