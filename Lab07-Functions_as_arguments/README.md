# Functions as arguments

## The concepts covered in this lab include:

1. Functions in Python
2. Passing functions as arguments to other functions
3. Lambda functions
4. Function aliasing and creating a list of functions
5. Using a dictionary of functions in a class method

## Brief summary
This lab document covers several Python programming concepts, including functions as arguments, lambda functions, function aliasing, and the FunctionDispatcher class. It provides code examples and explanations for each of these concepts, as well as exercises for the reader to practice using them. The main exercise involves creating a dictionary of functions and a FunctionDispatcher class that can call the appropriate function based on a given command key and list of integers. Overall, this lab document serves as a helpful resource for those looking to deepen their understanding of these Python programming concepts.

## Plan for the lab

1. Explanation of how functions in Python are stored in memory.
2. Explanation of how functions can be used as arguments for other functions or methods.
3. Explanation of lambda functions and their use cases.
4. Explanation of function aliasing and its use cases.
5. Implementation of the following methods
   - `total_sum`
   - `apply`
   - `square`
   - `magnitude`
6. Implementation of `FunctionDispatcher` class and creating a dispatcher using function aliasing.
